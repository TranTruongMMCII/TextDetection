----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Questions 156-159 refer to the following article.
    The new economy has created great busin
ess opportunities as well 
as great turmoil.  
Not since the Industrial Revolution have the stakes of dealing with change been so high.  Most traditional organizations have accepted, in th
eory at least, that they must make major 
changes.  Even large new companies recognize that they need to manage the changes associated with rapid entrepreneurial growt
h.  Despite some individual successes, however, 
this remains difficult, and few companies mana
ge the process as well as they would like.  Most companies have begun by installing ne
w technology, downsizing, restructuring, or 
trying to change corporate culture, and most 
have had low success rates.  About 70 percent 
of all change initiatives fail. 

 The reason for most of these failures is that 
in their rush to change their organizations, 
managers become mesmerized by all the different, and sometimes conflicting, advice they receive about why companies should change, wh
at they should try to accomplish, and how 
they should do it.  The result is that they lose focus and fail to consider what would work 
best for their own company.  To improve the odds of success, it is imperative that 

executives understand the nature and pro
cess of corporate change much better. 
 Most companies use a mix of both hard a
nd soft change strategies.  Hard change results in drastic layoffs, downsizing, and restructuring.  Soft change is based on internal organizational changes and the gradual development of a new corporate culture through 
individual and organization learning.  Both s
trategies may be successfu
l, but it is difficult 
to combine them effectively.  Companies that
 are able to do this can reap significant 
payoffs in productivity and profitability.  Page 13
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     156. What is the article mainly about? 
   (A) Corporate marketing plans 
  (B) New developments in technology 

  (C) Ways for companies to increase profits 

  (D) How companies try to adapt to new conditions 

 157. The word ﬁmanageﬂ in paragraph 1, line 6, is closest in meaning to 
     (A) correct 
  (B) attract 
  (C) handle 

  (D) regulate 

 
158. According to the article, why do so many attempts to change fail? 
     (A) Soft change and hard change are different. 
  (B) Executives are interested only in profits. 

  (C) The best methods are often not clear. 
  (D) Employees usually resist change. 
 
159. What is soft change based on? 
     (A) Changes in the corporate culture 
  (B) Reductions in company size 

  (C) Relocating businesses 

  (D) Financial markets

Subject: Yesterday™s meeting 
Dear Katharine, 

Thank you for taking the time to get together with us yesterday.  Everyone on our team felt that it was a 
productive meeting.  We have a better understanding of your project™s needs now, and we™ve started 
looking at ways to adapt our software to meet your requirements. 
While the basic function of the software is well suited
 to the project overall, as discussed, we will explore 
ways to adapt it to the needs of the different departments at Advantage that will be using it.  This will 

incur some additional 
cost, as we indicated
Šwe™ll provide details about that at our next meeting, once 
our engineers have assessed the changes that will need to be made. 
I™ve asked Peter Bodell to prepare a document for you that indicates when the Training and Consulting 
Department could start providing services to you.  He™ll send this information to you directly
Šsince 
you™ve worked with him in the past, it seems the most efficient way to go. 
As agreed, let™s set up a meeting for the week of No
vember 26 by which time our engineers will be able 
to outline their approaches to your departmental needs, and we™ll have the information we need to put 

together a contract. 
In the meantime, please fe
el free to contact me if you have any questions. 
Regards, 
Ujjwal
